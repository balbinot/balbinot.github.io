Globular clusters are collisional systems, meaning that their dynamics is
governed by two-body relaxation (close interactions between its stars). This
means that through energy equipartition the most massive stars will have the
tendency to sink to the centre of the cluster. This is expected to happen in a
time scale of the order of the relaxation time-scale. 

I have used HST/ACS data to study this phenomena in one globular cluster in the
Galaxy, NGC 6642. See my 2009 paper linked in the header of this page.

## The dissolution and evolution of stellar clusters

Due to internal evolution and the interaction with the tidal-field of the Milky
Way (or their host galaxy) star clusters will slowly dissolve. Understanding
the phenomena is crucial to link the current population of clusters in the
Galaxy to its original, pristine population. I have studied this phenomena,
both in our Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. More specifically I searched
for signs of dissolution in the form of tidal-tails and evidence of the tidal
influence on the rotation in the outskirts of these objects.

## Other stuff

Although not extremely popular in recent astronomy, globular clusters were the
first of (many) research topics I have tackled. Please take a look at my full
publication list to see more about it, or drop me a message. More often than
not, I will drop what I am doing for the chance to take a look at some cluster
data ;)
