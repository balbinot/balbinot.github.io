I was born in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre), the
capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. I did my BSc (Physics), MSc
(Astronomy), and PhD at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. During most
of undergrad I was supervised by Prof. Basilio Santiago and worked in a variety
of topics such as globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, stellar streams, and survey
design and preparation.  

After my PhD in 2014 I moved to a 4-year postdoctoral research position at the
University of Surrey (Guildford, UK), to work with Prof. Mark Gieles. There I
focussed mainly on the dynamics of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, heavily
linked to large photometric/astrometric surveys.  Since 2018 I have been working
on galactic archeology as a postdoc with Prof.  Amina Helmi at the Kapteyn
Institute in the University of Groningen (NL). My main focus now is on Gaia and
near-future spectroscopic surveys, such as WEAVE and 4MOST. I recently moved to
the Leiden Observatory to continue working on the same topics, this time in the
group of Dr. Anthony Brown, but still closely associated with the group in Groninigen.
