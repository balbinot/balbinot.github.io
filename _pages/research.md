I am an astrophysicist based at the Kapteyn Institute at the University of
Groningen and at the Leiden Observatory. I am working closely with the Euclid
team to curate, validate, and distribute the external catalogues and images
that will ultimately be complimentary to the exquisite imaging from the Euclid
satellite. My main research is on resolved stellar populations in the nearby Universe. I mainly
use statistical tools to mine for faint signal in large databases coming from
photometric and astrometric surveys. Ultimately I find and model dwarf galaxies
and stellar streams, which have only a handful of stars among billions of
contaminating ones.

I also have a variety of interests in neighboring fields such as multiple
populations in globular clusters, the structure and star formation of the LMC,
open clusters, and collisional dynamics. 

More recently I have been involved in large spectroscopic surveys such as
[WEAVE](https://ingconfluence.ing.iac.es:8444/confluence//display/WEAV/The+WEAVE+Project)
where I coordinate efforts for following up stellar streams and
[4MOST](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/),
where I am assisting in the construction and tunning of the calibration unit
for the spectrograph. Finally, I am also involved in the Gaia Data Processing
and Analysis Consortium (DPAC).
