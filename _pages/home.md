I am an astrophysicist based at the Leiden Observatory and a guest researcher at the Kapteyn Institute at the University of
Groningen. I mainly use statistical tools to mine for
faint signal in large databases coming from photometric and astrometric
surveys. Ultimately I find and model dwarf galaxies and stellar streams, which
have only a handful of stars among billions of contaminating ones.

I also have a variety of interests in neighboring fields such as multiple
populations in globular clusters, the structure and star formation of the LMC,
open clusters, and collisional dynamics. 

More recently I have been involved in large spectroscopic surveys such as
[WEAVE](https://ingconfluence.ing.iac.es:8444/confluence//display/WEAV/The+WEAVE+Project)
where I coordinate efforts for following up stellar streams and
[4MOST](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/),
where I am assisting in the construction and tunning of the calibration unit
for the spectrograph. Finally, I am also involved in the Gaia Data Processing
and Analysis Consortium (DPAC).
